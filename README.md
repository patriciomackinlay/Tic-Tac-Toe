# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Odin Project - Tic-Tac-Toe

In this project, I'll be putting function factories and IIFE into use to create a working Tic-Tac-Toe game for browsers. My goal is to have a functionally sound and visually attractive game, and to cement my knowledge of factories and the module pattern for object creation. The main obstacle for me in this project will be getting to grips with these concepts at the same time as getting the game working from the ground up.
